Now I sit back and design the rockets my classmates have to worry about flying.... Enough of this chatter ... got to get busy. See you."</p><p>Mars turned thoughtfully back to his desk. "That kid's got only one foot," he mused soberly. He looked down at his own injured leg and savagely kicked it against the wall.</p><p>"Your leg. Your poor, crippled leg ... what a fine crutch it has been," he bitterly reproached himself. "It proves you were one of the first in space, and you won't let people forget it.
