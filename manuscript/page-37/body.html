He chewed the end of his pencil methodically and savagely, his features blushing pink with anger as he remembered the tirade of words exchanged with Bronsen a week ago. "Stupid, insolent, day-dreaming pup," he snarled half aloud.</p><p>Vern stopped in mid-step, eyeing him in surprise. "Huh?" he said. "Did you say something to me?"</p><p>Mars grimaced.

Of course, I can't say what others think."</p></div> </div>
